#  Brother John real-time melody player for singleboard ARM computer MD-407

This joint project consists of a concurrent program that plays the melody of Brother John in the AUX port of the board.
The player can be controlled by typing certain letters and a numeric value into a io console trough
USB to control the player. This program uses TinyTimber which is a kernel made in Lule√• University and is written in C that enables concurrency
and easy access and handling of the IO ports on the ARM board. [TinyTimber](https://github.com/simait/TinyTimber) can be obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/simait/TinyTimber) or
this template that includes drivers for MD407. The TinyTimber template is to be places in the `src` folder for the program to work.

To build any of the projects then the ARM gcc & g++ toolchain is needed along with a way to send
the compiled software to your device such as GDB or by cable. Run `make *.mk` to compile and make the program.

There is also documentation about the MD-407 and the components used with it. The MD-407 and some
components are created by chalmers so some of the documentation is in Swedish. The documents can be
found in the `docs` folder.
